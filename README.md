# Image-classification-using-K-Means-clustering

This project mainly deals with using K-means algorithm for image classification using Scikit-learn.Here, we first preprocess
the images for clustering and deploy the k-means clustering algorithm. Then we use common metrics to evaluate the cluster 
performance, and visualise the high-dimensional cluster centroids.

The very popular MNIST Dataset is used for training that comrpises of 60000 images of 28x28 pixels size.

The python code(.ipynb) can be run and executed using Jupyter notebook, that can be installed using: pip install jupyter notebook
