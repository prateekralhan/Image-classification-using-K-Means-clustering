# Image-classification-using-K-Means-clustering

This project mainly deals with using K-means algorithm for image classification using Scikit-learn.Here, we first preprocess
the images for clustering and deploy the k-means clustering algorithm. Then we use common metrics to evaluate the cluster 
performance, and visualise the high-dimensional cluster centroids.

The very popular MNIST Dataset is used for training that comprises of 60000 images of 28x28 pixels size., and after successful
training and testing, the following results were obtained with an accuracy of 89%.
